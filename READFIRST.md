# Welcome dev team! 

For this semester, we will be using `.pdf` files initially for lecture slides (we will be transitioning to `.tex` for finals), `.md` files for information and material, and `.py` or `.c` files for the courses. 

0. Fork the project to your github account signed in here: `https://github.com/cascino/cp164review/fork`. 

1. Clone your repository and navigate to the project directory
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```
(replace `<repository-url>` with the actual repository url found on the repository page)

3. Create a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
(replace `<branch-name>` with `[YOUR NAME]-feature`, i.e., `jesse-fenwicktree`)

4. Add your name to `authors.md`, identify and add some missing files outlined in `READFIRST.md` and push!
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "[CHOOSE A BARN ANIMAL]"
git push origin <branch-name>
```
where <branch-name> is the name of the branch you created in step 3. Note that some folders in `material` are populated already (not fully).

Over the course of this semester, your roles be dynamic and will fall under the following categories:
- Structure (outline and gather important information and key points about course specific details (labs, assignments, dates), as well as writing material in conjunction with design)
- Lecturer (you will be responsible for delivering the lecture, and partly directing slideshow creation)
- Design (create slideshows using material outlined from structure in collaboration with the lecturer and write material)
- Implementation (set problems; provide solutions, testcases, and code stubs; and write editorial)
